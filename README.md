### Hi, I'm Nilo Ferreira ğŸ‘‹

<!--
I'm working to switch from desktop developer (In C#) to front-end developer (ReatJS/Next). I'm based in Recife, Brazil.

Since 1999 working with desktop development, working with ERP systems, with internal demands from the companies I worked in and some automation. In 2015 I started to have a demand on the front-end and made me study AngularJS (1.2) and ended up converting this application to ReatJS and thus modernizing the application.

I'm currently learning Next.
